        <h4>Bukayo Saka has been voted by our supporters as our men's first-team's Player of the Month for December.</h4>

        <h5>Hot off the heels of his excellent displays at the World Cup, the attacker starred in our games against West Ham United and Brighton & Hove Albion as he got on the scoresheet in both.

            The two strikes came at crucial times too, as he bagged the equaliser against the Hammers to help kick-start our comeback, while it took him just 66 seconds to get on the scoresheet at the Amex Stadium to set us on our way to a fifth-straight league victory.
            
         <br>Bukayo gathered 50% of the votes from our fanbase to edge out Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah for what is his fifth monthly club award <br>- only Santi Cazorla, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil have won more.</h5>
